Full Stack Grocery Delivery E-commerce website using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js

In this tutorial, we will build and deploy a fully functional grocery delivery website using MongoDB, Express, React And Node.js. We will also add the online payment gateways to place the order online, and then we will deploy this e-commerce website online for free.

First, we will create the frontend of our e-commerce website using React.js and Tailwind CSS. Where users can see the products and place orders. After that, we will build the seller or admin panel form where we can upload groceries on this website.

After building the frontend of our grocery delivery application, we will build the Backend using Express and node js. To store the products and user details we will use the MongoDB database in this full stack project.

After creating backend API's we will connect it with the frontend so that we can create a fully functional online grocery order website. Then we will add stripe payment gateway in this project to accept payments online.

And finally, we will deploy this full grocery delivery stack project on Vercel for free, then our website will be live, and anyone can place a grocery order on this grocery delivery website.
